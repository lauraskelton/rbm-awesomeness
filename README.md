Deep Learning Beer
======

Stacked Autoencoder
------
Deep learning neural network to predict beer recommendations

Analyzing hidden node input weights to find predictive correlations between different beers

Map of Beer Correlations
------
Visualization of correlations between different beers, with highly correlated beers positioned close to each other, and negatively correlated beers positioned far from each other, based on analysis of which beers are predictive or inversely predictive of user ratings of the other beers.
